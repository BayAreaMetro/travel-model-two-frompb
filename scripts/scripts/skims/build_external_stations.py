    This script reads the externals station information in external_station_file and outputs node
    and link files which can be read with cube to add the external station and connector links
    a network.

    The external_station_file should contain at least the following fields:

        ext_zone       - the zone/node number for the external station
        x              - the x coordinate for the station location
        y              - the y coordinate for the station location
        entrance_nodes - a semicolon delimited list of nodes that the station should connect to

    To keep things simple, links in both directions are built between the station and entrance nodes,
    regardless of whether or not the node is attached to a one-way road or not (in the case of a
    connector built in the incorrect direction, it will never get used).

    The node_correspondence_file is used to transfer the node/link numbers to those used in the specific
    network. The node_offset is the number of internal nodes in the network. The (sequential) external
    zone numbering will begin at (node_offset + 1).
